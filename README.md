# Tanzania Regions Solar Potential Analysis 

## Project Overview
This project uses **Google Earth Engine (GEE)** and the **ERA5-Land** dataset to map solar energy potential across Tanzania. By analyzing surface solar radiation data, I identified the most suitable regions for renewable energy development.

## Tech Stack
- **Analysis:** Google Earth Engine (Python API)
- **Visualization:** `geemap` & `folium`
- **Data Source:** ECMWF ERA5-Land (40-year climate reanalysis)

## Key Insights
- Identified high-radiation zones in central and western Tanzania.
- Created an interactive map to visualize solar suitability at a national scale.
